# Philosophers:

My own version of the project Philosophers from 42 School. A simulation of the dining philosophers problem.
With this project, we learn how to effectively use and manage concurrency in a program where all parallel
tasks are constantly depending on each other.

In this project we use multithreading to learn how to sync multiple theads in a single program.

## Madatory:
Control of the philosophers using mutex and threads.

## Bonus:
Control of the philosophers using semaphores and processes.
